I have over 15 years of experience working in product management and data science. Currently, I work as the Head of Product Management at Resume Worded, where I lead a cross-functional team of seven, building unique products that are helping people achieve more in their careers! I'm deeply passionate about creating loved and trusted products that help people navigate their careers and achieve their career goals.


Previously, I worked at ABC Startup as a Lead Data Scientist, improving products and services for our customers by using advanced analytics, setting up big-data analytical tools (i.e. Hadoop, BigQuery), creating and maintaining models, and onboarding new data sets.


If you catch me outside of work, I'm an adventurous traveler - 30 countries and counting - and an avid lover of tennis!


I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out at welove@resumeworded.com or DM on Twitter @resumeworded.

I have been working in sales for almost five years, and I am now planning a transition into corporate human resources. Although successful in my sales career, I have realized the aspects of my work I find most rewarding are all in HR-related functions:

- Solid foundation in HR affairs: As senior account executive, I have been responsible for a number of HR functions, including recruiting, interviewing, hiring and training new employees. A quick learner of complex concepts and legal issues, I am eager to broaden these competencies.


- Dynamic communication style: I am adept in building relationships, consensus and a shared sense of purpose. I am known for my ability to quickly establish trust with employees, mediate disputes and motivate others into action.


- Experience in corporate training: A constant throughout my sales career has been my passion for the design and delivery of staff development programs. Comfortable and experienced giving both large and small-group presentations, I have conducted hundreds of training seminars for diverse audiences across all organizational levels.
